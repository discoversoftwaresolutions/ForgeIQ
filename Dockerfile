# Command to run the Streamlit application
# Railway will inject a $PORT environment variable. Streamlit can use this if configured,
# or Railway will map its $PORT to the EXPOSEd port (8501).
# Using --server.port $PORT is often more direct.
# However, Streamlit uses --server.port without $ by default.
# We set STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT env var above, which Streamlit should pick up.
